Hello there my fellow developers reading this post. Recently I experienced burnout and that was really awful. Especially because of exams and all of the work that I've got to do. In this post I want to remind to you that you are a person and you need to have good working condition because it is very important for your mental health.

Here is a list of signs that your project leads you to a burnout:

1. Uncertainty in terms of the outcome of the work.
2. Uncertainty regarding the timeframe for completing the work.
3. Helplessness - you cannot influence certain factors in the work.
4. Giving more than you receive.
5. High stakes: it's always a win-or-lose situation.
6. A lot of communication.
7. Having to play a role and not being able to be your true self.

I don't want to engage in demagogy so here is the conclusion:

> **Rest**

> **Don't be very perfect**

> **Don't work like a maniac**
